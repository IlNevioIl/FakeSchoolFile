Youre lazy at home schooling and dont want to do your exercises? I got u :) 
My app creates files in pdf and odt format that can not be opened. 
You can determine how big the fake file should be :)

How to use:
It should be self explainentory.
You need Java installed to run the application. 
The fake file is on your desktop.
For now, only windows is supportet.

If you have questions or suggestions feel free to ask/write me.
