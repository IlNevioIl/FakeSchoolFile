Youre lazy at home schooling and dont want to do your exercises? I got u :) 
My app creates files in pdf and odt format that can not be opened. 
You can determine how big the fake file should be :)

How to use:
It should be self explainentory.
You need Java installed to run the application. 
The fake file gets created on your desktop.
For now, only windows is supportet.

If you have questions or suggestions feel free to ask/write me.

Notice: If the file is extremly large, you have to wait until its on the size you want it to be.
Ill add a progress bar for that soon.
